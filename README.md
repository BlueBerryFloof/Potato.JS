## Installation
There are 2 methods to install 1. being the fancy .sh file that can be run in one command on linux and 2. being the commands that the .sh file runs and works on windows and mac.
### 1 (WIP)
#### This is work in progress and will be un greyed when is in place if it is ungreyed it is inplace
1. Download the QI.sh file
2. Run the file
3. Wait till it is done and input the config data in like a token and stuff into the config (WIP is the config editor).

> Things to know:
> * It will create a run file name run.sh
> * There will be a destroy bot file named nukebot.sh this will uninstall the bot completely as possible
>
> Soon to be added:
>> * Auto update will be included in the run.sh and if there is a update it will ask the user if they want to update
>> * Improved installer
>
> Might never happen: 
>> * A GUI installer

### 2
Use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and other things to install Potato.Js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlueBerryFloof/Potato.JS.git
```
This will create a directory named Potato.Js with all the stuff to run the bot
```bash
cd ./Potato.js

sudo npm i
```
Open the directory and install dependencies and give it a moment. and then edit the config.json to your needs (fill in the bot token and other stuff like youtube token. The info on where to get these tokens is in the config)
```bash
node index.js
```
If there is any issues please contact me in the discord.
